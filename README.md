As a part of her graduation work, [joan789](http://joan789.deviantart.com/) created artwork
or a game based on solving physical puzzles.
This game is based on her artwork and ideas.
Unfortunately it is a little incomplete.

This game is also transpiled to JavaScript with help of [TeaVM](https://github.com/konsoletyper/teavm).
